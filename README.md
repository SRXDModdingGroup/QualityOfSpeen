### This repository is now archived.
 While this was intended to be a multi-feature mod, the only meaningful feature the mod brought was custom Rich Presence, which is going to be redone from the ground-up as a separate mod.
 The mod will remain open-source, but won't be updated anymore to work on the latest versions of the game.

# Quality of Speen
 Quality of Speen is a Spin Rhythm XD mod adding a bunch of Quality of Life features (duh) to the game.

# Current Features
- **Instant Restart!** Press the `Restart` key when playing to restart the track from the beginning. Check your settings which key is bound to `Restart`
- **Extended Discord Rich Presence!** Discord will now show if you failed a song or if you are editing one (and more!)
- *More coming soon! [Check out the trello board](https://trello.com/b/QOMHv5fA/quality-of-speen-features)*

# How to build
 Follow [this guide](https://github.com/Raoul1808/SpeenChroma/wiki/Building-the-mod) to build the mod.
